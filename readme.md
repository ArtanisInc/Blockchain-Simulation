# üîó Blockchain Simulation

## Overview
The **Blockchain Simulation** is a Python-based project developed to demonstrate the fundamentals of a blockchain. This project implements a simple blockchain with a Proof of Work mechanism, the ability to add blocks, Merkle root validation, and basic chain validation. It serves as an educational tool for understanding decentralized and immutable systems.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Implements a mining process where a valid proof is found by solving a computational puzzle.
- **Blockchain Integrity Validation**: Ensures that any tampered block is detected, reinforcing the immutability of the chain.
- **Merkle Root Calculation**: Ensures transaction integrity by using a hierarchical hash structure.
- **Blockchain Simulation**: Supports multiple peers contributing to the chain with simulated mining.
- **Corruption Simulation**: Allows for testing the blockchain's response when a block is corrupted manually.

## üì¶ Requirements

Ensure you have Python 3 installed.

## üöÄ Usage

### Running the Script

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the script from the command line to simulate a blockchain and observe its behavior:

```bash
python blockchain.py
```

You can also simulate corruption in the blockchain using the `-corrupt` argument, followed by the peer index, block index, and new proof:

```bash
python blockchain.py -corrupt <peer_index> <block_index> <new_proof>
```

Replace `<peer_index>` with the index of the peer (0, 1, 2...), `<block_index>` with the index of the block to corrupt, and `<new_proof>` with a new proof value.

### Example:

```bash
python blockchain.py -corrupt 0 2 9999
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Expected Output

When executed, the script will display the blockchain structure before and after potential corruption, as well as whether the blockchain is still valid.

### Sample Output:

```json
Blockchain before corruption:
[
    {
        "index": 1,
        "timestamp": "2025-03-19 09:59:39.462860",

Corrupting blockchain for Peer A at block 2.

Blockchain after corruption:

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

- **Adjust Proof of Work Difficulty**: Modify the `difficulty` parameter in the `Blockchain` class to change the mining difficulty.
- **Add More Peers**: Expand the list of peers in the simulation by adding more entries to the `peers` list in the script.
